This module is intended to give a broad overview of the discipline and get you started with using GIS software.


## Learning Outcomes


* Overview of the development of GIS
    * The first maps & surveys
    * Creation of map projections and spatial analysis methods
    * Development and proliferation of GIS technology
* Get your bearings with ArcGSI Pro software package
    * Introductory tutorials from ESIR
* Recreate a historical analysis using modern methods
    * Brief overview of digitizing and georeferencing
    * Introduction to spatial analysis
    * Create and share a map


# What is GIS?

The **GI** stands for **Geographic Information**.  The **S** can be either **Science** or **System**.  You will often see them used interchangeably because they are very closely related.  Basically, you do GI*Science* with a GI*System*.

## What is GIScience?

The science and study of geospatial information: GIScience is a framework we use to understand spatial information.  It is rooted in Cartography, the art and science of graphically mapping but it is inherently multidisciplinary and drawing on Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, Remote Sensing, and many other fields.

## What is a GISystem?

Any system or tool we use to store and analyze geospatial information can broadly be considered a GISystem.  Until a the late 20th century, atlases and library map catalogues were our most advanced GIS.  Now we have a wide range of computer and web based GISystems.  Ranging from the "desktop" GIS applications like ArcGIS Pro that you will be using to cloud computing systems that can Terabytes of planetary scale data.

## What can be done with GIS?

GIS can be used to help solve a wide range of geographic problems in different fields: 

* Epidemiology/Public Health
* Planning (Urban, Hazards)
* Conservation & Resource Management
* Economics
* Climate Science
* Ecology/Biology
* Social Justice

# TopHat Question 1

GIS is an acronym that stands for:

- Geographic Information Science
- Geographic Information System
- Both Geographic Information Science and Geographic Information System


# History of GIS

A holistic understanding of GIS can help you use it effectively **and** responsibly.  A good way to start off is to look at the history of the GIS and Cartography more broadly.

* In this section of the module, I will give a sweeping overview of the development of the discipline.
  * We'll start with the very first maps and end with the widespread adoption of GIS and proliferation of geospatial technology.


  
# Evolution of Cartography

The earliest maps presented diverse and abstract representations of reality.  They used very different medium than we do today today, and are sometimes quite difficult to see as maps today.

# Proliferation of GIS


GIS has become a powerful, widely used tool for GIS in recent decades.

# Proprietary GIS Software 

GIS is very much rooted in capitalism and the capitalist enterprise.  Consequently many of the initial developments in GIS were by for profit companies.  For example, [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) is a leading producer of GIS software.  They make ArcGIS Pro, the software package we will be working with most in this class.  

**Proprietary** software requires users to purchase a license in order to gain access and restricts access to source code, meaning users have no right to view or edit source code (inner workings of a program).  Common examples of proprietary technology include:
* Operating Systems: Windows OS, Mac OS, IOS
* Programming Languages: MATLAB, VBScript
* Software Packages: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Power Point etc.), Adobe Illustrator, IOS, ArcMap

Proprietary software licenses are often very expensive.  They pose a significant barrier to access for uses that aren't affiliated with large institutions.

# Open Source GIS

There are alternatives!  Open source software packages have proliferated in recent years and are a viable alternative to the traditional options.  The the internet has connected like-minded developers and allowed for collaboration across the globe.

**Open Source** software is free to use, published under an open copyright license.  Users have the right to view, edit, and distribute the source code.  Common examples of open source technology include:

* Operating Systems: Linux OS, Android
* Programming Languages: Python, R, Java, etc.
* Software Packages: Libre Office (Writer, Calc, Impress, etc.), Ink Scape, QGIS

Open source software is more accessible because its free to download and use.

## Open Street Maps


[Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/49.2839/-122.8340&layers=T) is a freely available public database of geospatial information.

## Programming Languages


Programming languages like Python and JavaScript can be used to conduct a variety of geospatial analysis and make webmaps.  I created the map below using JavaScript.  I'll talk a bit more about these methods later on in the term.

# Fremium Services

Companies like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) and google provide some geospatial services that are "free" to a point.  For example, [Google earth engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) provides its cloud based computational capabilities to non-commercial users free of charge.
