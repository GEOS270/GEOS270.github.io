They focus on GIS applications, giving you a chance to get hands on practice working with GIS software (ArcGIS Pro).  Most labs have associated videos and/or readings.  There is no textbook for the course, pdf files will be provided where applicable.  You can work through the labs in your lab section but they may also require some extra time outside of scheduled lab hours.\n\n* Labs will be formatted as open help sessions.  They are your chance to get one-on-one help from your TA and you may also use them to work collaboratively with your classmates.\n  * Lab attendance is not mandatory, but it is strongly encouraged.\n* There is course [piazza]({{< var piazza.link >}}) page which you can use post/answer questions about the lab materials.\n\n```{r include=FALSE}\n\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n#| tbl-cap: \"Lab Schedule for 2023 S1\"\n#| tbl-colwidths: [20,40,40]\n\nChecklist <- read.csv(file = 'sheets/LabTimes.csv',sep='|')\nkable(Checklist)\n\n```\n\n# Your TAs\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"30%\"}\n\n![](images/{{< var Lab.TA1.photo >}}){width=85%}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n::: {.table-reduced}\n\n |\n-----|:-----\nName|{{< var Lab.TA1.name >}}\nPronouns|{{< var Lab.TA1.pronouns >}}\nEmail|{{< var Lab.TA1.email >}}\nOffice|{{< var Lab.TA1.office >}}\n:::\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n{{< var Lab.TA1.about >}}\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"30%\"}\n\n![](images/{{< var Lab.TA2.photo >}}){width=85%}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n::: {.table-reduced}\n\n |\n-----|:-----\nName|{{< var Lab.TA2.name >}}\nPronouns|{{< var Lab.TA2.pronouns >}}\nEmail|{{< var Lab.TA2.email >}}\nOffice|{{< var Lab.TA2.office >}}\n:::\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n{{< var Lab.TA2.about >}}\n\n\n# Software and Computer Access\n\nYou will be using the ArcGIS Pro software package to complete your lab assignments.  This is a proprietary program (it costs money) that can **only** be run on the Windows operating system.  There are two options for accessing the software.  However, if you do not have Windows computer, you can only use option 1.\n\n## Option 1: Geography Lab Computers\n\nThe Geography Department has two computer labs (rooms 115 and 237).  They may be accessed in-person when the geography building is open or they can be accessed via remote desktop connection 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  All students will be given a UBC Geography logon, you should receive logon credentials by email before the first day of lab.\n\n* **Note**: There is a lab fee to use geography computers.  You must [pay the lab fee](http://geog-epayment.sites.olt.ubc.ca/fees/geoglab-fees/) or you will loose access to your account.  \n\n* If you have not received logon credentials, contact {{<var lab.LabHelp.name>}} at: {{<var lab.LabHelp.emial>}}\n\n### Remote Access\n\nTo remotely access lab computers, follow [these instructions](RemoteDesktop.pdf).  Information about the Geography Computer Labs can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/).  \n\n* **Note** the lab schedule and refrain from remotely accessing a computer while other courses are holding lab session in that room.  When accessing computers remotely - try to use computers that are located in room 239 as those are less likely to result in conflicts with in-person users.\n\n    * **If you are having trouble logging on remotely** try: adding \"geoglab\\\" in front of your username.\n\n![](images/remoteLoginScreen.png)\n\n\n## Option 2: Purchase a Student License\n\nYou may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer for $20. ArcGIS Pro requires a PC (i.e. a computer running Windows).  \n\n* If you have a Mac or Linux machine you can get around this by building a Windows partition on your hard drive or using a virtual machine.\n  * **We cannot** provide any support for this step of the installation and it will likely be easier for you to use Option 1 instead.\n\n**1** Check that your computer meets the system requirements for ArcPro using [this link](http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/Client/Standard/?apikey=50F41142-39B0-4061-97C2-BA7B7FE43D0E&refid=1186&item=12433).\n\n\n**2** Go [here](https://gis.ubc.ca/software/) to purchase, ArcGIS Pro.  Fill out the info, make your payment, and you should be given and ArcOnline Account and a link to download ArcGIS Pro.\n\n* If you run into any issues, contact Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca \n\n# Using Geography Lab Computers\n\nThis video gives an overview of some important steps when using the lab computers.\n\n![](videos/GEOS_270-Saving_Your_Work.mp4)\n\n## Setting up your Geography Lab Account\n\n### Initialize your H:/ Drive\n\n**When you first logon to geography lab computers with your account** find C:\\Apps\\RunOnce.bat in the file manager.  Double click on it to run it.  This will initialize your account and set up access to your **H:/** drive.\n\n<img src=\"images/RunOnce_File_Location.PNG\" alt=\"RunOnce\" class=\"inline\" width=\"500\"/>\n\n\n# Data Management\n\nIf you are working on a geography lab computer, it is particularly important for you to \"Work Locally, Save Remotely\"\n\n## Work Locally\n\nDuring your lab, you should save your work to **C:/temp**. This is a folder stored locally on the computer you are working on.  Since it's the same machine you're working on, ArcGIS Pro can easily and quickly access and save files in this folder.  \n\n* **Avoid** saving files to the Desktop or Documents folders and try to empty the Downloads folder frequently. These folders are all part of your user profile which travels to/from the server when you log in/off. The more data there is in the profile the longer it will take to log in/off. We had a student with 106GB on profile and it took 45 minutes to get in!\n\n## Save Remotely\n\nThe **C:/temp** drive can accessed by multiple users.  A single computer in room 115 might have 20-30 different students accessing it (in person + remotely) in a given week.  Each time a new user logs on, the **C:/temp** folder is at risk for being overwritten. \n\n* It is **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** that you save your work elsewhere before you log off.  When you sign up for your Geography lab account, you will be given server space known as your **H:/** drive folder; you should save your work here. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Save your Map document and close ArcGIS Pro or any other software you may be using (Word, Excel, etc. ...)\n\n2. Launch My Computer, and navigate to **C:/temp**\n\n3. Right click on your lab folder in **C:/temp** and select **Copy**\n\n4. Navigate to **H:/** and **paste** your lab folder here\n\n## Steps for Retrieving Work from H:/\n\n\nWhen you come back next time to complete the assignment, you will transfer the files in the reverse direction. This is because the **H:/** drive is stored on a networked server, not the local machine.  ArcGIS Pro will run slowly if you try to work directly from the **H:/** drive, which is why you **must transfer your files first**. To transfer your files:\n\n**1** Log in\n\n**2** Use My Computer to find **C:\\temp** and delete all the files you find there since they are likely not yours and you don't want to get mixed up.\n\n**3** Navigate to your **H:/** drive, select your current lab's folder , and copy it to **C:\\temp**\n\n**4** Resume your work\n\n## Windows Tips for Mac Users\n\nThe geography lab computers are currently running the Windows 10 OS.  Windows is quite different than the Mac OS, and for those who have little familiarity with Windows, there can be step (but short!) learning curve.  Here are a few resources that Mac users might find helpful to look through before starting lab:\n\n* [15 Windows 10 Tips for Mac Users](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/windows-10-tips-for-mac-users)\n\n* [16 tips for Mac users who must use Windows](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2476636/16-tips-for-mac-users-who-must-use-windows.html)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"labinfo.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","_quarto-vars":{"term":"2023 S1","quiz":{"instructions":"You can submit your answers to the Lab Quiz questions on Canvas.
