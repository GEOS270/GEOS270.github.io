We will learn how geospatial data can be used to aid decision-making, complement scientific analysis, assist with urban planning, and help inform policy-making.  You will gain practical experience using geospatial data to solve problems in both the natural and human realms.  This term we will cover:\n\n\n* How GIS functions and how it can be applied to solve problems.\n* How phenomena are represented as geospatial data in a GIS.\n* How to implement geospatial analysis methods.\n* Visualizing geospatial data and principles of good map design. \n* Sources of error in GIS analysis and output.\n* The ethical implications of GIS analysis.\n* GIS workflows and collaborating to complete a GIS project.\n\n\n# Important Information\n\n\n |\n-----|:-----\nLecture|{{< var keyInfo.lecture_time >}} in room {{< var keyInfo.lecture_room >}}\nRemote Attendance|[Via zoom]({{< var keyInfo.zoom >}})\nLecture Recordings|View [here]({{< var keyInfo.recordings >}}) \nTopHat Join Code|{{< var keyInfo.tophat_code >}} \nPiazza Page|Find it [here]({{< var keyInfo.piazza_link >}})\n\n\n\n# Course Overview\n\nThe course is arranged in a modular format, with due dates for each module shown in the schedule below.  The modules are designed to introduce and cover specific topics within GIS, and are published as separate webpages.  \n\n\n```{r include=FALSE}\n\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-schedule\n#| tbl-cap: \"Important Dates\"\n#| tbl-colwidths: [20,65,15]\n\nDueDates <- read.csv(file = 'sheets/DueDates.csv',sep='|')\nkable(DueDates, col.names = gsub(\"[.]\", \" \", names(DueDates)))\n\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nLab quizzes will make up the largest portion of your grade, followed by the final exam and final project which will be weighted equally, with Lecture Participation (via TopHat) making up the rest of your grade.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-grades\n#| tbl-cap: \"Components of your final grade\"\n#| tbl-colwidths: [20,30]\n\ngrades <- read.csv(file = 'sheets/GradeBreakdown.csv',sep='|')\nkable(grades, col.names = gsub(\"[.]\", \" \", names(grades)))\n\n```\n\n### Lab Assignments\n\nThe first six modules each have a lab assignment.  Lab instructions are included on this website in each module's pages (e.g., see [Lab 1 instructions here](/Modules/1/instructions.qmd)).  Each lab assignment has a corresponding set of questions (e.g., see [Lab 1 questions here](/Modules/1/questions.qmd)).  Take note of the answers as you work through the lab then submit you answers to canvas afterwards.\n\n* Everyone gets one **\"free pass\"**: your lowest scoring lab quiz will be dropped at the end of term.\n\n### Final Project\n\nGIS is a collaborative discipline so your final project will be a group assignment (2-4 members).  The project can be on any topic you choose, but I will also provide you with a set of project ideas to help get you started.  More info will be provided later in the term.\n\n\n### Final Exam\n\nThe final exam will be will be cumulative, drawing from both lecture and lab material.  It will consist of a flowchart question illustrating how to complete a GIS task, essays/short answers, and miscellaneous fill in the blanks, matching, multiple choice, etc. type questions.  It will be {{< var exam.type >}} and is scheduled for **`r tail(DueDates$Due.Date, 1)`**.  More info will be available closer to the exam date.\n\n### Lecture Participation\n\nLectures are held in person {{< var keyInfo.lecture_time >}} in room {{< var keyInfo.lecture_room >}} with a remote attendance option available on [on zoom]({{< var keyInfo.zoom >}}). Recordings will be made available [here]({{< var keyInfo.recordings >}}) for convenience, but lecture participation points are only available **during** keyInfo.\n\nLecture participation will be gauged using [TopHat](https://tophat.com/students/).  The course **Join Code** is: **{{< var keyInfo.tophat_code >}}**.  \n\n* TopHat questions can **only** be answered during the lecture session\n  * They will be available to in person and remote attendees\n  * They can be answered via mobile device or laptop\n* Questions will be marked based on participation (50%) and correctness (50%)\n  * Anonymized answers will be reviewed in lecture to help gauge comprehension\n\n### Extra Credit\n\nExtra credit will offered at multiple points through the term.\n\n* The course also has a [piazza]({{< var keyInfo.piazza_link >}}) page which can be used to ask/answer questions about assignments and course materials.  Students who are active and helpful on the piazza page will be offered extra participation credit at the end of term.\n* An extra credit programming exercise at the end of term will give you an opportunity to try you hand at GIS Programming\n* Final project proposal early submissions will receive extra credit as well\n\n \n# Your Instructor\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"30%\"}\n\n![](images/{{< var instructor.photo >}}){width=85%}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n\n |\n-----|:-----\nName|{{< var instructor.name >}}\nPronouns|{{< var instructor.pronouns >}}\nEmail|{{< var instructor.email >}}\nOffice Hours|{{< var instructor.office >}}\nZoom Office Hours|{{< var instructor.zoom_office >}} \n\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n{{< var instructor.about >}}\n\n\n\n# Course Policies\n\nMy aim for this semester is to provide a flexible and supportive learning environment while respecting the boundaries of myself and your TAs.  These course policies are intended to establish a framework for navigating the course.\n\n## Feedback & Deadlines \n\nLab assignments will be marked by your TA using a standard rubric.  Short comments will be provided where applicable on written answers & map submissions.  Submissions will be accepted without late penalty for {{< var Lab.grace_period >}} days after their due date.\n\n* Quizzes submitted **by the due date** will be graded and returned with feedback {{< var Lab.grace_period >}} days of the due date.\n* Late submissions **waive their right** to prompt grading/feedback.  \n  * Late quiz submissions **will not** receive written feedback from your TA.\n  * Late quiz submissions will be marked whenever is convenient for your TA, which could be as late as the end of term\n  * After the {{< var Lab.grace_period >}} day grace period, the quiz submission window will **close**, no exceptions.\n* This policy only applies to the lab quizzes, **not** the final project or exam.\n\n\n## Absences\n\nIf you are sick (with COVID or otherwise), please stay home to protect others and take care of yourself.  Lectures are streamed [on zoom]({{< var keyInfo.zoom >}}) so that you may still attend online and get TopHat participation credit.  Lecture recordings are also [here]({{< var keyInfo.recordings >}}).  If you miss a lab session, you can attend an alternate session, just make sure to check in with TA running that session.\n\n##  Accommodations\n\nPlease contact the [Center for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) if you require accommodations for a disability.  Once you are registered please make me aware of any necessary accommodations by email in a timely manner.\n\nI will make accommodations on a case by case basis for extenuating circumstances that prevent you completing course work.  It is your responsibility to communicate your needs in a timely fashion (i.e. **before** a due date).\n* If you require an accommodation please contact {{< var instructor.name >}} by email: {{< var instructor.email >}}\n* My typical approach is to give an alternative assignment rather than giving extensions on lab quizzes because we post the answers after submission deadlines:\n  * An alternative lab might consist of writing up an essay or two pertaining to the lecture material + making any maps/figures from the lab, then submitting directly to me by email anytime before the last day of class.\n\n## Academic Concessions\n\nIf you require an [Academic Concession](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/) please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation for your situation.  You are not obligated to explain your personal circumstances to me to justify the concession, my inent is to be accomodating.  However, you must to communicate any need for a concession in a timely manner.  If you require multiple concessions I may refer you to [Arts Advising](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/).\n\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.\n\nPlagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously.  The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment.  Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero.  A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found [here](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-integrity/Links)\n\nThough you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information.\n\n# Strategies for Success\n\n**Be proactive!** \n\n* Keep track of deadlines & note the late submission policies\n  * Timely communication is important!  If you have an issue, please bring it to my attention.\n  * Partial credit is better than no credit.  If you can't finish a lab before the deadline - just submit what you've got done already. \n* Drop by office hours & ask questions!\n* Don't wait until the last minute to set up ArcGIS Pro, do it now to save yourself a headache down the road."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","_quarto-vars":{"course":{"term":"2023 S1","code":"GEOS 270"},"instructor":{"name":"Dr. June skeeter","pronouns":"They/Them/Theirs","email":"june.skeeter@ubc.ca","office":"Room 144, Geography Bldg Office hours after lecture","zoom_office":"By Appointment **with at least 24 hr notice** [Office Hours Link](https://ubc.zoom.us/j/66359522453?pwd=ZzZUMzV3NVY1V3pzcmYzZFBadW93UT09)","photo":"June.jpg","about":"My name is June.
