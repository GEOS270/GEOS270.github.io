The **S** can be either **Science** or **System**.  You will often see them used interchangeably because they are very closely related.  Basically, you do GI*Science* with a GI*System*.\n\n## What is GIScience?\n\nThe science and study of geospatial information: GIScience is a framework we use to understand spatial information.  It is rooted in Cartography, the art and science of graphically mapping but it is inherently multidisciplinary and drawing on Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, Remote Sensing, and many other fields.\n\n## What is a GISystem?\n\nAny system or tool we use to store and analyze geospatial information can broadly be considered a GISystem.  Until a the late 20th century, atlases and library map catalogues were our most advanced GIS.  Now we have a wide range of computer and web based GISystems.  Ranging from the \"desktop\" GIS applications like ArcGIS Pro that you will be using to cloud computing systems that can Terabytes of planetary scale data.\n\n## What can be done with GIS?\n\nGIS can be used to help solve a wide range of geographic problems in different fields: \n\n* Epidemiology/Public Health\n* Planning (Urban, Hazards)\n* Conservation & Resource Management\n* Economics\n* Climate Science\n* Ecology/Biology\n* Social Justice\n\n---\n\n# TopHat Question 1\n\nGIS is an acronym that stands for:\n\n- Geographic Information Science\n- Geographic Information System\n- Both Geographic Information Science and Geographic Information System\n\n\n# History of GIS\n\nA holistic understanding of GIS can help you use it effectively **and** responsibly.  A good way to start off is to look at the history of the GIS and Cartography more broadly.\n\n* In this section of the module, I will give a sweeping overview of the development of the discipline.\n  * We'll start with the very first maps and end with the widespread adoption of GIS and proliferation of geospatial technology.\n\n\n  \n# Evolution of Cartography\n\nThe earliest maps presented diverse and abstract representations of reality.  They used very different medium than we do today today, and are sometimes quite difficult to see as maps today.  \n\n<div style=\"overflow: hidden;\n  padding-top: 56.25%;\n  position: relative\">\n  <iframe src=\"content/HistoyGIS.html\" title=\"Processes\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"\n    style=\"border: 0;\n   height: 100%;\n   left: 0;\n   position: absolute;\n   top: 0;\n   width: 100%;\">\n   <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\n </iframe>\n</div>\n<a href=\"content/HistoyGIS.html\" target=\"_blank\">View slides in new tab</a>\n\n<!-- Download the slides as a .pdf [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/June-Skeeter/Module1_GEOS270/main/docs/content/EarlyHistoy.pdf)\n -->\n\n\n## References\n\nGartner, W.

Consequently many of the initial developments in GIS were by for profit companies.  For example, [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) is a leading producer of GIS software.  They make ArcGIS Pro, the software package we will be working with most in this class.  \n\n**Proprietary** software requires users to purchase a license in order to gain access and restricts access to source code, meaning users have no right to view or edit source code (inner workings of a program).  Common examples of proprietary technology include:\n* Operating Systems: Windows OS, Mac OS, IOS\n* Programming Languages: MATLAB, VBScript\n* Software Packages: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Power Point etc.), Adobe Illustrator, IOS, ArcMap\n\nProprietary software licenses are often very expensive.  They pose a significant barrier to access for uses that aren't affiliated with large institutions.\n\n## ArcGIS Pro\n\n\n<img src=\"content/images/ESRI_license.png\" width=\"1000\">\n\n---\n\n# Open Source GIS\n\nThere are alternatives!  Open source software packages have proliferated in recent years and are a viable alternative to the traditional options.  The the internet has connected like-minded developers and allowed for collaboration across the globe.\n\n**Open Source** software is free to use, published under an open copyright license.  Users have the right to view, edit, and distribute the source code.  Common examples of open source technology include:\n\n* Operating Systems: Linux OS, Android\n* Programming Languages: Python, R, Java, etc.\n* Software Packages: Libre Office (Writer, Calc, Impress, etc.), Ink Scape, QGIS\n\nOpen source software is more accessible because its free to download and use.\n\n## QGIS\n\n\n<div style=\"overflow: hidden;\n  padding-top: 56.25%;\n  position: relative\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.qgis.org/en/site/\" title=\"Processes\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"\n    style=\"border: 0;\n   height: 100%;\n   left: 0;\n   position: absolute;\n   top: 0;\n   width: 100%;\">\n   <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\n </iframe>\n</div>\n<a href=\"https://www.qgis.org/en/site/\" target=\"_blank\">View slides in new tab</a>\n\n## Open Street Maps\n\n\n[Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/49.2839/-122.8340&layers=T) is a freely available public database of geospatial information.\n\n\n\n![](../images/OSM.png)\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n\nProgramming languages like Python and JavaScript can be used to conduct a variety of geospatial analysis and make webmaps.
