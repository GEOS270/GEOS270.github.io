    "text": "The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map. Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

The report should have the following sections:\nIntroduction – What is the problem? Why should we care? Briefly introduce the scope of the issue you are addressing and conclude your introduction with your research statement.\n\nResearch Statement – What is/are the specific question(s) you are looking to address?\n\nData Sources – What data are you using & where did they come from? What type of data are you working with (raster, vector, tabular)? What’s the scale & resolution, is these limiting factors? Are there any issues or special considerations with this data set? A table might be a useful way to help summarize this section concisely.\nMethods – What did you do? Why did you do it? Explain the analysis steps you took and justify the choices you made in your analysis. You can rely heavily on your flow charts for explaining the methods. You don’t need to detail every little step, be brief but throughout.\n\nDon’t Say things like: “We doubled clicked the buffer tool and set Layer A as the input. We set the buffer distance to 1000 meters and clicked dissolve all. We set the output name as Layer B and hit run. Then we merged Layer B with Layer C naming it Layer D”\nInstead Say: “We buffered Layer A by 1000 m because (justification). Then we merged it with Layer C”\nFlowchart is best included here!\n\nResults – What does your analysis say? Describe the general patterns and trends that your analysis yielded.\n\nMaps/charts go here!\n\nConclusions – What are the overarching conclusions? Did you find what you expected? Did you answer the research statement? What are some potential future analysis that could result from this?\nBibliography – Cite any data sources used. Also cite any relevant literature. It is not expected that you conduct a literature review, just make sure to cite any you do use. Reference them in a consistent format\nFigures and Tables - Maps, charts, and any other figures or tables you make should be included in your report near the relevant spot location in the text the are mentioned. Figures should be labelled numerically, as should any tables (using separate counts eg., Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1, etc.). You can reference figures & tables in text using these numbers.\n\nThere is not set number of figures or tables (you may not need any tables). That will be determined by the context of what you are doing.\nAll figures will be assessed based on the principals of design discussed in lecture.\n\nThere is no word/page count. You can keep the report brief, just be thorough. Make sure you explain and discuss the key points."

Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.\nPlagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously. The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment. Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found here\nThough you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information."

This will be the name of the folder your project is saved in. Set the location to an appropriate workspace.\n\nI am working on my own computer, and my workspace workspace is “C:\\2021_S1”. This is the location where the project folder will be reside. If you are working on a lab computer, you should put your project in C:.\nIt is very important to familiarize yourself with the procedures for saving your work if you are working on a lab computer.\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Windows operating system (OS), it might be helpful to take a few moments to learn about the differences between Windows and the OS (Mac, Linux) you are used to working with. Once you set up a new project, close ArcGIS Pro for now.\n\n\n\nGeodatabases\nBy default, ArcPro creates a geodatabase with every new project. You will see one called Lab1_Project.gdb in your project folder. See the definitions below for important info about geodatabases.\nGeodatabase: A file management structure that is unique to ESRI products. You don’t have to store your data in a geodatabase (.gdb), but they have some enhanced functionality that makes them better than regular folders in some circumstances. One helpful thing we can do in a .gdb, is create a feature dataset to store our census data.\nFeature Dataset: A collections of feature classes that are all in the same coordinate system. When you add a data to a feature dataset, it will automatically be projected into the coordinate system we specify. This can help us avoid making mistakes like working with data that is in the wrong coordinate system!\nFeature Class: A vector data layer stored in a geodatabase. Its a special file type created by ESRI to store data effectively within ArcGIS Pro. When vector data layers are not stored in a geodatabase, they are stored in other formats, such as shapefiles or geojsons.\n\n\nDownload Data\nLets download the data we need and put it in the Lab1_Project folder you just created. Click the download link. If a pop up appears, choose save, the file will be saved in the downloads folder.\n\n\nExtract the Data\nOpen the windows file explorer (folder on bottom ribbon or search the start menu). Navigate to the downloads folder. You will see a folder called “CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb”, note the type “Compressed (zipped) Folder” and size 11709 KB. Right click on the CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb, choose a zip file manager, and select “Extract files”.\n\nZip files (.zip) are a method for compressing data so it can be stored and transfered more efficiently. However, to work with the data, we have to extract it.\nOn my computer, the 7-Zip is the .zip file manager. If you are working on the geography department computers, you can uses PeaZip instead. The specific options might differ, but the general principal is the same.\n\n\n\n\nSave it to your Project Folder!\nIn the pop up window, set your Lab1_Project folder as the Extract to location.\n\nThe lab data is now downloaded and stored in your project folder."

I’ve gone thought most of the steps of extracting the data for you already. This section walks you through the process of how it is typically done.\n\nGeoreferencing\nIn order to get a historical map into a GIS, it has to be scanned and then georeferenced. To georeference a map like, locations on the scanned image (eg. intersections) can be matched up to known reference points.\n\nWith enough matching points (>=3), an accurate transformation can be calculated and the paper map can be referenced to the proper location. I’ve done this for you to save some time.\nWatch the video linked below for a quick overview of georeferencing.\n\n\n\nOnce a map has been georeferenced, we can extract information from it. On Dr. Snow’s map, the key pieces of information are the cholera deaths and water pumps. To get this information into the GIS, the points have to be manually identified and entered. This process is known as digitizing, and was explained in the Create points on a map video. We’ll get some practice digitizing in a bit."

    "text": "Spatial Analysis\nWe already know the Broad St. pump was the source of the outbreak, but lets explore a couple analysis techniques we could use to identify the source of an outbreak.\n\nMeasures of Central Tendency\nThere are numerous ways to analyze the spatial distribution of a dataset. The Mean Center and Directional Distribution are two of the simplest measures. Mean center gives you a single point around which the directional distribution creates an ellipse to show directional trends in the data. Don’t calculate these statistics, just skim the linked pages and look at the example below to understand what these methods do.\n\nThey can be weighted (eg. by the number of deaths per address).\nThese measures roughly identify the Broad St. Pump as the source of the outbreak, as shown in the figure below.\n\nHowever, they are rudimentary metrics at best. They could be used to identify multiple point sources for example.\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel Density\nA more advanced method is Kernel Density, which gives you a magnitude (eg. number of deaths) per unit area (eg. hectare). Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below to calculate the Kernel Density of cholera deaths in Soho.\n\nClick the Analysis tab and select Tools. In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and open the Kernel Density tool.\n\n\nThe Geoprocessing pane is where you can find all the different spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS Pro.\n\n\nSet Deaths as the input and COUNT as the Population Field.\n\n\nThe population field weights the calculations by the number of deaths at each address.\n\n\nRerun the analysis multiple times, playing around with different Output cell sizes and Area units. When you are done exploring the effects of cell size and units, calculate the Kernel Density with a cell size of 5 and unit of Hectares.\n\n\nA Hectare is 10,000 m2, or about the area a small city block.\n\nVideo\n\n\nSave your project.\nClick Save in the top left of the Arc Pro window."

    "section": "Monitoring Vegetation with Satellites",
    "text": "Monitoring Vegetation with Satellites\nWe’re going to work with LANDSAT8 data in this lab. LANDSAT8 is one of a large number of satellites that orbit the earth continuously collecting multi-spectral (visible light & other wavelengths) imagery. We can use multi-spectral imagery for a number of different applications like estimating vegetation health.\n\nCalculating NDVI\nThe lines on the chart below are referred to as a spectral reflectance curves. They show reflectance (amount of light) on the y-axis, defined as the percent of radiation reflected by different earth features, and wavelength on the x-axis. As you can see, the spectral reflectance curves for different features look very different. Specifically, you can see that healthy green vegetation has very high reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths (0.7-1.4 µm) and lower reflectance in the visible part of the spectrum (0-0.7 µm), while water absorbs almost all incoming infrared radiation and thus has very low infrared reflectance. Soil has relatively higher reflectance in the visible wavelengths, and intermediate reflectance in the near infrared.\n\nThese differences are the basis for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), one of the most commonly used spectral indices for vegetation monitoring. NDVI is calculated as:\n\\[ NDVI = \\frac{(NIR-Red)}{(NIR+Red)} \\]\nwhere NIR is reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths, and RED is reflectance in the red wavelengths. This index can range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating more/greener/healthier vegetation. Look at the graph above and make sure you understand why green vegetation would have a high value of NDVI.\nThe gray shaded areas indicate regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are measured by a satellite. These regions are referred to as “spectral bands.” When you work with satellite imagery, you will have one raster for each band. The values for each raster contain the reflectance measured by the satellite in that band. (This will make more sense in a minute, when you start working with the satellite data)."

Reference the video below if you have trouble.\n\nGoogle quickly processes your request and adds the image to your screen. You can change the transparency or turn the image on/off with the check box.\nThis image is a “Greenest Pixel” - the code queries all LANDSAT8 data, calculates NDVI for every location in the map view, and then selects the maximum NDVI value at each location, which represents the peak greenness (across all seasons/years) and adds it to the image!\nZoom and pan a bit to explore!\n\nVideo\n\nDownloading the Data\nFollow these steps to download the NDVI data. You can reference the video below for help. Note the export dialog has changed slightly since the video was recorded (see screenshot below video). In order to download data for a specific area, we first need to create and upload a boundary file.\n\nIn the ArcGIS Pro Geoprocessing pane, find the Dissolve tool and set VanCMA_CT_2016 as the input\n\n\nNote: by default, the output will be saved to your Van_NDVI.gdb as a feature class.\n\nHowver, feature classes can not be read by Google Earth Engine.\nInstead: save the output as a Shapefile (.shp) one level up in your Van_NDVI project folder and name it Boundary. Shapefiles are just a different way of storing vector data.\n\n\n\nRemove this layer from your table of contents. We don’t need it in this map project.\n\nVideo\n\nUpload the Boundary file you just created to google earth engine.\n\n\nGo to the Assets tab (top left)\nClick New > Shape files\nNavigate to your Van_NDVI folder and upload the Boundary file you created.\n\nTry to upload all the files named Boundary. GEE will tell you which (eg. .sbx) file types it won’t accept. Exclude them and upload the rest\n\nClick refresh to see your upload\n\nIt may take a few minutes to show up, the video has been edited for brevity\n\n\n\nImport the Boundary file into the code.\n\n\nClick on the boundary file you uploaded, and select import.\nIt will import in the top of the code window.\n\nBy default it names it “table”, change the name to Boundary.\n\n\n\nRun the download.\n\n\nScroll to the bottom of the code.\nIn Javascript the double backslash “//” will “comment out” code or text so that it is ignored by the processor.\n\nHighlight the commented out section of code and hit “ctrl + /” to get rid of the double back slashes.\nAlternatively, you can just manual delete the double back slashes.\n\nClick Run\nSwitch to the Task pane in the top right. Run the Van_Greenest task to export this layer to your Google Drive.\n\nGoogle Drive is a free (15GB) file storage service that comes with a Google account.\n\n\n\nGo to your Google Drive and find the Van_Greenest.tif, it should be located in the root folder.\n\n\nIt could take 5/10 minutes for GEE to process your request. Right click on it to download it an put it in your Van_NDVI folder.\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nProject the Raster Layer\nBy default, data from GEE is not projected! It comes in the WGS 1984 Geographic Coordinate System (Lat/Lon referencing the WGS 1984 Datum). We need to get it into NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10N so it matches the rest of our data! Feature Datasets only work for Vector data. The NDVI data is in the Raster data format. So we have to reproject it manually. Raster data requires a slightly different tool to do the re-projection than the vector data we worked with in Modules 1-3. The steps and video below goes shows you how to do that.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, search for the Project Raster tool.\nSet the projection to UTM Zone 10N (find in your favorites for quick access).\nAfter running, the Van_Greenest_ProjectRaster should show up on your map.\nNow would be a good time to save your project!\n\nVideo"

    "text": "Vector Layers & Plotting Relationships\nThese Census data are in Vector format. A key advantage of Vector Data is that we can have multiple attributes associated with each entity (point/line/polygon). Here, we are interested in three variables: Population (total residents), Housing (monthly rent), and Income (annual total).\n\nSymbolize your census data by population.\n\n\nSet the Field to Population\nChange the symbology for Van_DA_2016 to Graduated Colors\nExplore how the different classification schemes influence the way the classified layer looks on the map\n\n\nMake a Histogram of Population.\n\n\nSet the number to population\nMake sure the mean, median, and standard deviations are all shown on the Histogram.\n\n\nCreate a chart income vs. housing.\n\n\nRight click Van_DA_2016 and click Create Chart > Scatter Plot.\nIn the chart properties tab set:\n\nX-axis: Income\nY-axis: Housing\n\nMake sure “Show linear trend” is checked to display a regression line on your chart.\n\n\nNote the zero values on the X & Y Axes. Stats Canada “suppresses” data when they don’t get enough responses to a census question. No house in Vancouver is worth $0. We need to exclude the zeros so they don’t skew our results.\n\n\nIn the Map tab, click Select by Attribute, select for “Housing” greater than 0 And “Income” greater than 0.\n\nSelect by Attribute allows us to select rows/objects with a certain attribute.\nIt relies on something called a Structured Query Language (SQL).\nWe are selecting all rows “Where” our conditions are met.\n\nYou can use the And/Or commands to combine querries.\nAnd: Selects whre All statements are true\nOr: Selects whre Any statements are true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Linear Regression\nA regression line is also know as a “line of best fit”. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between some an independent variable (e.g. Income) and a dependent variable (eg. Housing). This is the simplest form of regression is know as Simple Linear Regression.\n\nIn this model, the dependent variable Y is influenced by the independent variable X proportional to the slope m. If m = 1 means a 1:1 relationship between X & Y, m = 2 would mean Y increases by 2 units for every 1 unit increase in X, m = 0.5 would mean Y increases by 1/2 unit for every 1 unit increase in X. The intercept b accounts for an offset (bias) in the model.\n\n\\[ Y=mX + b \\]\n\nAny deviations from this linear relationship are “errors”. That is, all the other variability that cannot be explained by the model. Housing cost is impacted by many factors (eg. scarcity) that aren’t as easy to capture with census data alone.\nIn the example below for Van_DA_2016 (before excluding zeros), M = 0.0123 and b = 660.1, which means at $0 income, rent is $660.1. And for every $100 increase in income, rent goes up $1.23.\n\n\nThe R2 score, is known as the coefficient of determination. It is a measure of how well a model fits the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing “no fit” and 1 representing a “perfect fit”.\n\nThis table shows how we assess the strength of a relationships indicated by the R2 statistics. In the example above, there is no strong relationship.\n\n\n\n\nR2\nRelationship\n\n\n\n\n<0.3\nVery Weak\n\n\n0.3 - 0.5\nWeak\n\n\n0.5 - 0.7\nModerate\n\n\n>0.7\nStrong\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing CTs to DAs\nRepeat the steps above for the VanCMA_CT_2016 layer. Don’t forget to exclude the zeros on your scatter plot. Note there are fewer zeros overall. Think about why that might be. Hint look at the population of CTs compared to DAs"

    "text": "Ordinary Least Squares Regression\nLike the name suggests, simple linear regression is … simple. It can only account for the influence of one independent variable at a time. Reality is rarely this straightforward and typically there are numerous factors influencing a dependent variable. A more general version of linear regression is known as Ordinary Least Squares regression. This model allows us to account for multiple dependent variables. For instance, a three factor OLS model (three dependent variables) would look something like this:\n\\[ Y=aX_1 + bX_2 + cX_3 + d \\]\n\nX1, X2, and X3 are all dependent variables and a, b, and c are their respective coefficients (slopes) while d is the intercept.\nImagine a simple example that might be used in the real word: trying and estimate the total damage in dollars (Y) from a storm:\n\nX1 = maximum wind speed\nX2 = total rainfall\nX3 = population of area effected.\n\nThis model won’t give a perfect estimate, but by accounting for two aspects of the storm it will do a much better job describing the storm than just wind speed or rainfall alone. Further, by accounting for population it will give us some idea of number of people impacted. A storm in an uninhabited area wont cause much damage regardless of its strength, but in a large metro area it will cause significant damage.\nThink about how this model might be applied to improve our analysis?"

    "text": "Traditional Knowledge and Records of Past Tsunamis\nDespite the scientific communities’ assumptions that the CSZ was not a threat, knowledge of the destructive potential of the CSZ was preserved in the oral histories of coastal indigenous peoples from British Columbia to Northern California. There are numerous histories describing a massive earthquake and tsunami that occurred sometime around 1700. These histories were transcribed between 1860 and 1964. Read the highlighted sections of Ludwin et al. (2005), which can be found here\n\nIt wasn’t until the 1990’s that scientific research began to shown that the CSZ was capable of producing megathrust earthquakes and tsunamis. Tree ring studies and historical accounts of a Tsunami in Japan pinpoint the timing of the last major CSZ earthquake at 21:00 Pacific time on January 26, 1700.\nIn fact, there have been at least seven megathrust earthquakes exceeding 8.0 magnitude in the last 3500 years. The recurrence interval for massive earthquakes along this fault line are estimated to be between 243 and 500 years.\nIn 2010, geologists predicted a 37% chance of a magnitude 8.2+ event within 50 years, and a 10 to 15% chance that the entire Cascadia subduction zone will rupture with a magnitude 9+ event within the same time frame.\n\nThis example highlights both the arrogance of the scientific community and the lack of value it has historically attributed to traditional knowledge."

In British Columbia, the Tsunami’s impacts were most devastating in Port Alberni, where 55 homes were washed away and 375 more were damaged. Port Alberni is especially vulnerable to Tsunamis because of its specific geography. Located at the head of 40km long fjord, Tsunami waves are amplified as they are funneled up the fjord.

Hint\nSubmit a .pdf of the map you created to showing the updated inundation zone and shelter locations. Hint\nWrite a paragraph or two comparing the method used in Module 5 (previous method) model to identify the Inundation Zone vs. the method used in this Module 6 (this assignment) to identify the Inundation Zone. Things to consider: What tools/steps were used in each model? Which do you think produces a more useful result? What are some potential pros/cons of the different methods? Hint\nRead the highlighted portions of Chae et al. (2015) on racism and health outcomes.
