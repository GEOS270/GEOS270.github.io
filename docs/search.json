    "text": "The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map. Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

Take note of the answers as you work through the lab then submit you answers to canvas afterwards.\n\nEveryone gets one “free pass”: your lowest scoring lab quiz will be dropped at the end of term.\n\n\n\nFinal Project\nGIS is a collaborative discipline so your final project will be a group assignment (2-4 members). The project can be on any topic you choose, but I will also provide you with a set of project ideas to help get you started. More info will be provided later in the term.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThe final exam will be will be cumulative, drawing from both lecture and lab material. It will consist of a flowchart question illustrating how to complete a GIS task, essays/short answers, and miscellaneous fill in the blanks, matching, multiple choice, etc. type questions. It will be asynchronous over Canvas and is scheduled for June 28. More info will be available closer to the exam date.\n\n\nLecture Participation\nLectures are held in person Tuesday & Thursday, 12:00 - 14:00 in room 101 with a remote attendance option available on on zoom. Recordings will be made available here for convenience, but lecture participation points are only available during keyInfo.\nLecture participation will be gauged using TopHat.

As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.\nPlagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously. The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment. Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found here\nThough you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information."

This will be the name of the folder your project is saved in. Set the location to an appropriate workspace.\n\nI am working on my own computer, and my workspace workspace is “C:\\2021_S1”. This is the location where the project folder will be reside. If you are working on a lab computer, you should put your project in C:.\nIt is very important to familiarize yourself with the procedures for saving your work if you are working on a lab computer.\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Windows operating system (OS), it might be helpful to take a few moments to learn about the differences between Windows and the OS (Mac, Linux) you are used to working with. Once you set up a new project, close ArcGIS Pro for now.\n\n\n\nGeodatabases\nBy default, ArcPro creates a geodatabase with every new project. You will see one called Lab1_Project.gdb in your project folder. See the definitions below for important info about geodatabases.\nGeodatabase: A file management structure that is unique to ESRI products. You don’t have to store your data in a geodatabase (.gdb), but they have some enhanced functionality that makes them better than regular folders in some circumstances. One helpful thing we can do in a .gdb, is create a feature dataset to store our census data.\nFeature Dataset: A collections of feature classes that are all in the same coordinate system. When you add a data to a feature dataset, it will automatically be projected into the coordinate system we specify. This can help us avoid making mistakes like working with data that is in the wrong coordinate system!\nFeature Class: A vector data layer stored in a geodatabase. Its a special file type created by ESRI to store data effectively within ArcGIS Pro. When vector data layers are not stored in a geodatabase, they are stored in other formats, such as shapefiles or geojsons.\n\n\nDownload Data\nLets download the data we need and put it in the Lab1_Project folder you just created. Click the download link. If a pop up appears, choose save, the file will be saved in the downloads folder.\n\n\nExtract the Data\nOpen the windows file explorer (folder on bottom ribbon or search the start menu). Navigate to the downloads folder. You will see a folder called “CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb”, note the type “Compressed (zipped) Folder” and size 11709 KB. Right click on the CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb, choose a zip file manager, and select “Extract files”.\n\nZip files (.zip) are a method for compressing data so it can be stored and transfered more efficiently. However, to work with the data, we have to extract it.\nOn my computer, the 7-Zip is the .zip file manager. If you are working on the geography department computers, you can uses PeaZip instead. The specific options might differ, but the general principal is the same.\n\n\n\n\nSave it to your Project Folder!\nIn the pop up window, set your Lab1_Project folder as the Extract to location.\n\nThe lab data is now downloaded and stored in your project folder."

I’ve gone thought most of the steps of extracting the data for you already. This section walks you through the process of how it is typically done.\n\nGeoreferencing\nIn order to get a historical map into a GIS, it has to be scanned and then georeferenced. To georeference a map like, locations on the scanned image (eg. intersections) can be matched up to known reference points.\n\nWith enough matching points (>=3), an accurate transformation can be calculated and the paper map can be referenced to the proper location. I’ve done this for you to save some time.\nWatch the video linked below for a quick overview of georeferencing.\n\n\n\nOnce a map has been georeferenced, we can extract information from it. On Dr. Snow’s map, the key pieces of information are the cholera deaths and water pumps. To get this information into the GIS, the points have to be manually identified and entered. This process is known as digitizing, and was explained in the Create points on a map video. We’ll get some practice digitizing in a bit."

    "text": "Creating a New Feature Dataset\nUsing the steps outlined in the video on creating point features, we are going to create a new feature class called “Broad St. Pump” and digitize the location of the pump. Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below.\n\nRight click on SourcePoints in the catalog pane and click New > Feature Class.\nIn the new window that opens, give the new feature a name and alias, set the type to point, and click Next.\n\n\nArc Pro does not allow Feature Classes to have certain characters (eg. spaces) in file names. But you can set the alias to display spaces\nFeature classes can take multiple different types. The three most common, which we will mainly be concerned with are: Points, Lines, and Polygons\n\nWe’ll discuss the differences in detail in lecture\n\n\n\nAdd a new field called Name with type text then click Next.\n\n\nFields allow us to store information about the features in a table. In this case, the only information we want to store is the name. We will encounter circumstances later where we store many attributes for each feature.\n\n\nNote the Spatial Reference System then click Finish.\n\n\nFeature Datasets require that all feature classes within them have the same Spatial Reference System, so the projection is automatically set to that of the SourcePoints feature dataset (WGS 1984 Web Mercator)\n\nIf you aren’t working in a preexisting feature dataset, this would be your chance to specify it\n\nWe don’t need to concern ourselves with the options on the next three pages for now.\n\nVideo\n\nDigitizing a Point\nNow we are going to digitize the location of the Broad St. Pump. Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below.\n\nFind the Snow_cholera_map in the CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb, click and drag it onto the map.\nOpen the Edit tab and click Create, in the create pane that appears, click Broad St. Pump and choose point from the options that appear.\n\n\nThe edit tab allows us to create, modify, save, and delete data among other things\nCreate is used specifically to add new features to an existing feature data set.\n\nRight now we’re creating a single point feature. We’ll learn how to digitize lines and polygons later on in the semester.\n\n\n\nClick on the location of the Broad St. pump as shown on Dr. Snow’s original map, then save your edits.\n\n\nZoom into the Broad St. area on the map, click on the location of the pump to add a point feature.\n\nIf you make a mistake, you can hit ctrl + z to undo your additions\nNote Snapping is sometimes set to on by default. It will cause the cursor to jump to the nearest feature in another layer (eg. Deaths). It is useful in some situations, but not here. It can be turned off by clicking snapping in the Edit tab.\n\nSave your edits after every change to make them permanent.\n\n\nOpen the attribute table and name the newly created feature “Broad St. Pump”\n\n\nYou can type directly into the attribute table to edit the newly created features Name value, which is blank for now.\nClicking a new row in the attribute table will add and “empty” feature with no spatial component.\n\nYou can right click on a row to delete that feature\n\nSave your edits to make them permanent.\n\nVideo\n\n\nSave your project.\nClick Save in the top left of the Arc Pro window. ArcPro will auto save for you every so often, but its good practice to get in the habit of saving everything regularly anyway just incise."

Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below.\n\nClick on Deaths then click the Appearance tab, choose Single Symbol from the Symbology drop down.\n\n\nThe appearance tab let’s you make changes to the way data is represented on your map.\n\n\nIn the symbology pane that opens, under gallery, choose the red triangle, then adjust the properties to fine tune the symbology. Select the Broad St. Pump and symbolize the it as a larger circle marker in a different color.\n\n\nYou can change various properties of the point symbols to make them easier to see (eg. outline width, point size).\nSize, color, and shape all convey meaning. We’ll discuss the various implications of symbology later in the semester.\n\nVideo\n\nAdding Labels\nNow we are going to add a label to Broad St. Pump so the map reader can identify it. Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below.\n\nRight click on Broad St. Pump and click Label.\n\n\nNote a label appears next to the point but it isn’t very easy to read.\n\n\nRight click on Broad St. Pump again and click Labeling Properties, change the font size and add a halo to make the label easier to read.\n\n\nHalos can make your text stand out against a background. Increasing the font size also helps the text stand out.\nYou can change many other aspects of the label text. Play around with the properties to see what happens when you make changes. Hit apply after each change.\n\nVideo\n\n\nSymbolize by Count\nLets adjust the symbology so the Deaths feature class points are scaled by the number of deaths at each address. Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below.\n\nClick on Deaths and navigate to symbology. Select graduated symbols from the drop down.\n\n\nGraduated point symbols are sized differently to convey magnitude/intensity.\n\n\nPlay around with the symbology options.\n\n\nClicking template allows you to select a the point marker type.\nThe Size and Classes allow you to decide how many classes and how small-large the points should be.\nThe Class tab allows you to specify class breaks manually.\n\nVideo\n\n\nSave your project.\nClick Save in the top left of the Arc Pro window."

    "section": "Spatial Analysis",
    "text": "Spatial Analysis\nWe already know the Broad St. pump was the source of the outbreak, but lets explore a couple analysis techniques we could use to identify the source of an outbreak.\n\nMeasures of Central Tendency\nThere are numerous ways to analyze the spatial distribution of a dataset. The Mean Center and Directional Distribution are two of the simplest measures. Mean center gives you a single point around which the directional distribution creates an ellipse to show directional trends in the data. Don’t calculate these statistics, just skim the linked pages and look at the example below to understand what these methods do.\n\nThey can be weighted (eg. by the number of deaths per address).\nThese measures roughly identify the Broad St. Pump as the source of the outbreak, as shown in the figure below.\n\nHowever, they are rudimentary metrics at best. They could be used to identify multiple point sources for example.\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel Density\nA more advanced method is Kernel Density, which gives you a magnitude (eg. number of deaths) per unit area (eg. hectare). Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below to calculate the Kernel Density of cholera deaths in Soho.\n\nClick the Analysis tab and select Tools. In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and open the Kernel Density tool.\n\n\nThe Geoprocessing pane is where you can find all the different spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS Pro.\n\n\nSet Deaths as the input and COUNT as the Population Field.\n\n\nThe population field weights the calculations by the number of deaths at each address.\n\n\nRerun the analysis multiple times, playing around with different Output cell sizes and Area units. When you are done exploring the effects of cell size and units, calculate the Kernel Density with a cell size of 5 and unit of Hectares.\n\n\nA Hectare is 10,000 m2, or about the area a small city block.\n\nVideo\n\n\nSave your project.\nClick Save in the top left of the Arc Pro window."

Change the symbology of Kernel Density to 5 classes so it fits on the legend better and edit the layer name to make it more clear. Reorder the legend items if desired. * Legends items have many different settings we can fine tune. For now, we’ll just change a few. * You can add/remove & reorder legend items using the check box on the right. * Changing the number of classes in the Kernel Density layer makes it fit better. * Slowly double clicking on an item in the table of contents on the left allows you to edit the text. You can change layer names so they make more sense.\n\n\nTitle\nAdd a a title using the Straight Text (see video). Give your map an appropriate title and font size.\n\nTitles should be concise and descriptive.\nThey should be the largest font element on the map\n\n\n\nSource Statement\nUse the same procedure to add a data source, creator name, and date to the map.\n\nIt is important to credit data sources.\nList yourself as the creator.\nAdd a date so the reader knows when the map was created.\nThe credit text can be smaller and “tucked away” at the bottom of the map.\n\n\n\nScale Bar and North Arrow\nAdd a north arrow & scale bar\n\nMake sure your units are in metric!\n\nVideo"

    "text": "Monitoring Vegetation with Satellites\nWe’re going to work with LANDSAT8 data in this lab. LANDSAT8 is one of a large number of satellites that orbit the earth continuously collecting multi-spectral (visible light & other wavelengths) imagery. We can use multi-spectral imagery for a number of different applications like estimating vegetation health.\n\nCalculating NDVI\nThe lines on the chart below are referred to as a spectral reflectance curves. They show reflectance (amount of light) on the y-axis, defined as the percent of radiation reflected by different earth features, and wavelength on the x-axis. As you can see, the spectral reflectance curves for different features look very different. Specifically, you can see that healthy green vegetation has very high reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths (0.7-1.4 µm) and lower reflectance in the visible part of the spectrum (0-0.7 µm), while water absorbs almost all incoming infrared radiation and thus has very low infrared reflectance. Soil has relatively higher reflectance in the visible wavelengths, and intermediate reflectance in the near infrared.\n\nThese differences are the basis for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), one of the most commonly used spectral indices for vegetation monitoring. NDVI is calculated as:\n\\[ NDVI = \\frac{(NIR-Red)}{(NIR+Red)} \\]\nwhere NIR is reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths, and RED is reflectance in the red wavelengths. This index can range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating more/greener/healthier vegetation. Look at the graph above and make sure you understand why green vegetation would have a high value of NDVI.\nThe gray shaded areas indicate regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are measured by a satellite. These regions are referred to as “spectral bands.” When you work with satellite imagery, you will have one raster for each band. The values for each raster contain the reflectance measured by the satellite in that band. (This will make more sense in a minute, when you start working with the satellite data)."

It comes in the WGS 1984 Geographic Coordinate System (Lat/Lon referencing the WGS 1984 Datum). We need to get it into NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10N so it matches the rest of our data! Feature Datasets only work for Vector data. The NDVI data is in the Raster data format. So we have to reproject it manually. Raster data requires a slightly different tool to do the re-projection than the vector data we worked with in Modules 1-3. The steps and video below goes shows you how to do that.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, search for the Project Raster tool.\nSet the projection to UTM Zone 10N (find in your favorites for quick access).\nAfter running, the Van_Greenest_ProjectRaster should show up on your map.\nNow would be a good time to save your project!\n\nVideo"

    "text": "Vector Layers & Plotting Relationships\nThese Census data are in Vector format. A key advantage of Vector Data is that we can have multiple attributes associated with each entity (point/line/polygon). Here, we are interested in three variables: Population (total residents), Housing (monthly rent), and Income (annual total).\n\nSymbolize your census data by population.\n\n\nSet the Field to Population\nChange the symbology for Van_DA_2016 to Graduated Colors\nExplore how the different classification schemes influence the way the classified layer looks on the map\n\n\nMake a Histogram of Population.\n\n\nSet the number to population\nMake sure the mean, median, and standard deviations are all shown on the Histogram.\n\n\nCreate a chart income vs. housing.\n\n\nRight click Van_DA_2016 and click Create Chart > Scatter Plot.\nIn the chart properties tab set:\n\nX-axis: Income\nY-axis: Housing\n\nMake sure “Show linear trend” is checked to display a regression line on your chart.\n\n\nNote the zero values on the X & Y Axes. Stats Canada “suppresses” data when they don’t get enough responses to a census question. No house in Vancouver is worth $0. We need to exclude the zeros so they don’t skew our results.\n\n\nIn the Map tab, click Select by Attribute, select for “Housing” greater than 0 And “Income” greater than 0.\n\nSelect by Attribute allows us to select rows/objects with a certain attribute.\nIt relies on something called a Structured Query Language (SQL).\nWe are selecting all rows “Where” our conditions are met.\n\nYou can use the And/Or commands to combine querries.\nAnd: Selects whre All statements are true\nOr: Selects whre Any statements are true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Linear Regression\nA regression line is also know as a “line of best fit”. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between some an independent variable (e.g. Income) and a dependent variable (eg. Housing). This is the simplest form of regression is know as Simple Linear Regression.\n\nIn this model, the dependent variable Y is influenced by the independent variable X proportional to the slope m. If m = 1 means a 1:1 relationship between X & Y, m = 2 would mean Y increases by 2 units for every 1 unit increase in X, m = 0.5 would mean Y increases by 1/2 unit for every 1 unit increase in X. The intercept b accounts for an offset (bias) in the model.\n\n\\[ Y=mX + b \\]\n\nAny deviations from this linear relationship are “errors”. That is, all the other variability that cannot be explained by the model. Housing cost is impacted by many factors (eg. scarcity) that aren’t as easy to capture with census data alone.\nIn the example below for Van_DA_2016 (before excluding zeros), M = 0.0123 and b = 660.1, which means at $0 income, rent is $660.1. And for every $100 increase in income, rent goes up $1.23.\n\n\nThe R2 score, is known as the coefficient of determination. It is a measure of how well a model fits the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing “no fit” and 1 representing a “perfect fit”.\n\nThis table shows how we assess the strength of a relationships indicated by the R2 statistics. In the example above, there is no strong relationship.\n\n\n\n\nR2\nRelationship\n\n\n\n\n<0.3\nVery Weak\n\n\n0.3 - 0.5\nWeak\n\n\n0.5 - 0.7\nModerate\n\n\n>0.7\nStrong\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing CTs to DAs\nRepeat the steps above for the VanCMA_CT_2016 layer. Don’t forget to exclude the zeros on your scatter plot. Note there are fewer zeros overall. Think about why that might be. Hint look at the population of CTs compared to DAs"

However, they are useful because they allow us to represent continuous phenomena (i.e. vegetation health) as a simple image.\n\nCreate a Histogram\nTo get a feel for the distribution of NDVI values in the dataset, we’re going to plot them in a histogram to aid our visual inspection of the NDVI data.\n\nCreate a chart showing the count of cells by NDVI values.\n\n\nA histogram represents a distribution by grouping the data into bins (ranges), and plotting the count of values (eg. raster cells) for by bin.\n\nChange the bin number to see how changing the size of the bins, impacts how you perceive the data. Try 10, then try 50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse The Natural Breaks Classification\n\nSearch for the Reclassify tool in the geoprocessing pane. Use the projected NDVI layer as the input.\n\n\nClick classify to set the classification scheme. Set the method to Natural Breaks and the number of classes to 3.\n\nWe talked about the Natural Breaks Classification in Module 3.\nIt is designed to automatically find an “optimal” fit to a dataset.\n\nWe can use it to group the NDVI values into three classes:\n\n1: Water/Urban (lowest values)\n2: Medium Density Residential (middle values)\n3: Green Vegetation (highest values)"

You can reference the video below for guidance.\n\nFind the Raster to Polygon tool in the geoprocessing pane.\n\n\nSet the Classified NDVI image as the Input raster\nChoose Value as the Field\n\n\nFind the Intersect tool in the geoprocessing pane. It will combine the feature classes where they overlap and exclude all other areas. We’ll talk a lot more about this tool.\n\n\nSet Van_DA_2016 and the output from the raster to polygon conversion as the inputs. Then click run.\nChange the symbology and open the attribute table to confirm the results look like what we’d expect.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the Green Vegetation Area and Dissolve by CT\nNow we are going to calculate the total green vegetation area by CT, and toss out a bunch of the unnecessary data. You can reference the video below for guidance.\n\nAdd a new field to the VanCMA_CT_2016_Intersect layer called “Green_Veg_Area” so we:\n\n\nName the field Green_Veg_Area\nMake sure the data type is Double.\n\n\nChoose Select by Attribute and set your query to: Where gridcode is equal to 3.\nRight click on Green Veg Area and choose Calculate Field. This allows us to define a function and apply it to the table.\n\n\nSet the expression to: Green_Veg_Area = Shape_Area\n\nNote you only need to complete the right side of the equation\nThis will simply copy the shape area for the green vegetation areas, we will work with a more complex expression on the next page.\n\n\n\nWe want to assign all other rows a 0. We can quickly invert our selection with the Switch button.\n\n\nCalculate the field again, but with Green_Veg_Area = 0\n\nWe have selected gridcode 1 & 2 (Not vegetation) so they all get zeros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Normalization\nOne last thing step! We need to account for a confounding factor. The CTs are different sizes. To better compare the CTs (which are vastly different sizes), lets Normalize our results by the total area of each CT! Normalizing, sometimes also referred to as standardizing, is the process of dividing one variable by another variable to account for their relationship. It can help us identify patterns that might be masked by a confounding variable.\n\nAdd a new field called “PCT_Green_Space”.\n\n\nMake sure you set the data type to Double\n\n\nCalculate the field using the following equation:\n\n\nPCT_Green_Space = SUM_Green_Veg_Area/Shape_Area\n\nNote you only need to complete the right side of the equation\n\n\n\nRight click on PCT_Green_Space and select “Statistics”\n\n\nThis will bring up some descriptive statistics for this field."

    "text": "Ordinary Least Squares Regression\nLike the name suggests, simple linear regression is … simple. It can only account for the influence of one independent variable at a time. Reality is rarely this straightforward and typically there are numerous factors influencing a dependent variable. A more general version of linear regression is known as Ordinary Least Squares regression. This model allows us to account for multiple dependent variables. For instance, a three factor OLS model (three dependent variables) would look something like this:\n\\[ Y=aX_1 + bX_2 + cX_3 + d \\]\n\nX1, X2, and X3 are all dependent variables and a, b, and c are their respective coefficients (slopes) while d is the intercept.\nImagine a simple example that might be used in the real word: trying and estimate the total damage in dollars (Y) from a storm:\n\nX1 = maximum wind speed\nX2 = total rainfall\nX3 = population of area effected.\n\nThis model won’t give a perfect estimate, but by accounting for two aspects of the storm it will do a much better job describing the storm than just wind speed or rainfall alone. Further, by accounting for population it will give us some idea of number of people impacted. A storm in an uninhabited area wont cause much damage regardless of its strength, but in a large metro area it will cause significant damage.\nThink about how this model might be applied to improve our analysis?"
